# Gemini XMPP Bot

[Permalink: Gemini XMPP Bot](https://github.com/jjj333-p/gemini-xmpp#gemini-xmpp-bot)

This is just a little bot I made, honestly just wanted alt text to describe images when I cant open them in public
(for moderation), but I figured while I was plumbing in gemini I might as well let you chat with it and discuss the
images too.

### Use

[Permalink: Use](https://github.com/jjj333-p/gemini-xmpp#use)

- It will scan every url found, and respond to the ones that are supported images
- messages starting with its displayname it will respond to.
- Messages starting with the image generation model (`hidream` on this instance) will generate an image
- use `{displayname}, forget` to clear context window
- use `{displayname}, help` to get back here
